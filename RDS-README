This is my repository off my GitHub Forked from another who made it Linux
friendly.  He copied it from TheCherno and we are waqiting for TheCherno 
to pull the udate into his repository.  Once that is done and TheCherno
has updated his repository I will switch to syncing his to keep in step 
with what he is doing.  For now this will have to do.

See the premake5.lua file in the root directory to see my comments on how
to create a new Sandbox directory for a new OpenGL project.

In case you forget all the binaries go to the bin ... directory!
